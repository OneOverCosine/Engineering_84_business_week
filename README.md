## Business Week

### 1. TMAY
Hello, my name is Dunni and I graduated from Goldsmiths university with a degree in Computer Science.  
During the course of my degree I got cover a variety of subjects, including Web dev and software projects.  
I also got to work with Java, Python, HTML + CSS + JavaScript...  
Came to like Computer Science through Maths --> Might have done Engineering, but I found I was better suited to Computer Science.  
In my free time I like drawing (cats) and doing other creative things.

### 2. What is Agile, and what is the benefit of implementing it?
Agile can be described as a mindset or an approach to project management. It revolves around having an iterative approach to project management and software development. An Agile team delivers work in small increments instead of all at once. This allows the team to be more flexible and ready to deal with the inevitable changes they are going to face during development. Through the/(this?) process, requirements and plans are coninually evaluated to teams can respond to change quickly.  

### 3. Why did I choose Sparta?  
I first heard about Sparta through codemas.  
This was during lockdown and I was looking to improve my Java and Python skills.  
codemas sounded interesting so I gave it a look. I ended up really liking how the instructor taught so I decided to look into Sparta  
One thing I noticed was the sense of community. I really liked the focus on supporting trainees (and beyond).  
That, to me, set Sparta apart from the others like them.  

### 4. What is Scrum and what is the benefit of implementing it?
Scrum is an Agile framework *not* a methodology. Scrum is meant to be simple.  
It's built upon a series of sprints which which gives the team a chance to review work before proceeding.  
Useful because everyone is involved in development. Has a high level of transparency and openness so problems get caught before they get far

### 5. Where do you see yourself in 2-5 years?
At the end of my two years at Sparta I hope to move on to join the company I'm working with as a DevOps consultant if I like it there. If not, I'll likely stay on with Sparta and keep developing my skills with them. I'd like to work towards being on the more technical side of the role as a Senior DevOps engineer.

### 6. What is DevOps and benefit of using it?
A combination of Development and Operations.  
- It brings the Development and Operations teams together, allowing them to work better together.
- Without DevOps, the teams work independently and often run into problems because of slight differences in their goals. Development often prioritises rolling out new and frequent updates while Operations want stability with each build.
- With DevOps there's better communication between the teams
