# A reminder of projects I've worked on and what I did in them

## Airport Terminal Project at Sparta Global (2021)
- This was a training project for the final Python week in the DevOps course
- Followed Agile methodology, using Scrum
- Programming based on OOP principles
- Tools used: Python, SQL Server, Git and GitHub, Flask
- Main contributions were dealing with the display and logic of the CLI (*not* SQL stuff)
- Was Scrum master for a day (for training purposes) and got to practice organising the team
- Was in charge of maintaining the readme

## 2021 Global Game Jam
- Joined a team of six to create a puzzle game
- Was part of the programming team
- Main contribution was implementing the movement mechanics for the player (constraining the movement to one square at a time)
- Also helped with setting up menus (both main and pause) + their functionality

## Final Year Project (2019 - 2020)
- Made a prototype for a puzzle platformer
- Used Unity with C# (had little experience before starting)
- Learned a lot about these tools on the way using online resources
- Got the chance to improve my research methods
