# Python Related Interview Qs [WIP]

## What is OOP? Mention the pillars
Object Oreinted Programming (OOP) is a programming standard base on the concept of 'objects'.  
These objects can contain data in the form of fields (called attributes) and code in the form of procedures (called methods)  
OOP is held up by four 'pillars'. These are:
- Abstraction
- Inheritance
- Encapsulation
- Polymorphism

## Abstraction
This is the process of hiding information from the user. Only the essential features are shown. An example of abstraction in everyday life is a digital camera - or any commonly used camera. Users only need to know how to press a few buttons and maybe change some settings to take a good picture. They don't need to know how pressing those buttons work - just that they do work.

## Inheritance
Inheritance is a way to reuse code. Similar to inheritance in real life, (left off here)

- An object can inherit attributes (which are an object's variables) and methods (the behaviour of an object)

## Encapsulation
It is the 'bundling' or binding of data. Consider a tablet. Everything you need for that medicine is contained within the tablet. It's this concept that we want to apply to programming. Encapsulation is about binding variables and functions together in a class. Everything you need get bundled together. You don't need to look elsewhere for what you need.

## Polymorphism
The word itself means 'many forms'
An example of polymorphism in Python is a function with the same name but different functionality.

## What are the benefits of OOP?

## Best use case
