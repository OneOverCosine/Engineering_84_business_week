## What is OOP? Mention the pillars
Object Oreinted Programming (OOP) is a programming standard base on the concept of 'objects'.  
These objects can contain data in the form of fields (called attributes) and code in the form of procedures (called methods)  
OOP is held up by four 'pillars'. These are:
- Abstraction
- Inheritance
- Encapsulation
- Polymorphism

## Abstraction
This is the process of hiding information from the user. Only the essential features are shown. An example of abstraction in everyday life is a digital camera - or any commonly used camera. Users only need to know how to press a few buttons and maybe change some settings to take a good picture. They don't need to know how pressing those buttons work - just that they do work.

## Inheritance
Inheritance is a way to reuse code. In programming, this allows us to create a base or 'parent' class which other classes can share attributes and methods from. Say you had a ``Cat`` class that could ``hunt()``, ``stalk()``, and ``eat()``. You can make classes based off of ``Cat`` (like ``American_shorthair``) that would also have the methods ``hunt()``, ``stalk()``, and ``eat()`` without needing to rewrite that code.

- An object can inherit attributes (which are an object's variables) and methods (the behaviour of an object)

## Encapsulation
It is the 'bundling' or binding of data. Consider a tablet. Everything you need for that medicine is contained within the tablet. It's this concept that we want to apply to programming. Encapsulation is about binding variables and functions together in a class. Everything you need gets bundled together. You don't need to look elsewhere for what you need.

## Polymorphism
The word itself means 'many forms'. In short, this pillar refers to the concept in programming of having functions with the same name but different functionality. This can also apply to variable within classes contaning different values.  
For example:  
``Cat`` is a class that has the value ``fur = True``. ``Sphinx`` (a breed of cat and therefore a child of the ``Cat`` class) would have ``fur = False``, as these cats are hairless.
